# concurrent-servers
To examine popular [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)) models for network servers that handle multiple clients simultaneously, and judge those models on scalability and ease of implementation. All servers will listen for socket connections and implement a simple protocol to interact with clients.  

Unlike a sequential server, a concurrent server is one that is able to serve more than one client at a time.
